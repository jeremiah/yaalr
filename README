yaalr - Yet Another Apache Log Reader

yaalr aims to stoke your vanity by reporting back to you how popular you are. 
It does this by reading your Apache log file which is clearly a proxy for 
your (or your company's) ideas. Use it to feel good about yourself, or to 
measure where you can do better. Hopefully yaalr is indifferent, it'll report
how many people have visited your site whether you are popular or not.


yaalr is a perl script licensed under the GPL. This means you can do as you 
please with it. Steal the code, mock it, whatever. It reads an apache log
file of various formats, and produces a report in the terminal. Newer 
functionality allows you to create a set of statistics  showing what type of 
hits you have had based on http status codes. To get this type of information 
use the --stats switch. 

More technical information on yaalr is available in the yaalr manual.
